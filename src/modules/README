Mustikkabot uses a modular system, where you can just put new modules in a folder to add new features.

There are a few guidelines a module must follow:

- The (main) file for the module must end in .py
- The .py file must contain a class with the same name as file without extension

Optional:
- The class may contain a method called init(self, bot), that will be called when the module is loaded
- The class may contain a method called dispose(self), that will be called when the module is being unloaded

An Example (example.py):

class example:

    bot = None
    file = None

    def init(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
        self.file = open("file", "r")

    def dispose(self):
        self.file.close()


(End of example)
