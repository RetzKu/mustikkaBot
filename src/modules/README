Mustikkabot uses a modular system, where you can just put new modules in a folder to add new features.

There are a few guidelines a module must follow:

- The (main) file for the module must end in .py
- The .py file must contain a method getId() which returns an unique string
- The .py file must contain a class with the same name as the string returned by getId()
- The class must contain a method called init(self, bot)

An Example (example.py):

def getId():
    return "example"

class example:
    
    def init():
        pass # Do whatever we want

(End of example)

The module-loader calls the init() method upon loading. In it is possible to register event callbacks and other actions (setup threads, call other python modules, ...).
