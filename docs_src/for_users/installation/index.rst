Install
-------

Unpack the archive downloaded in the last step to a location of your choice.

Make a copy or rename the file 'config/config.txt.template' as 'config/config.txt' and fill the fields inside.

If on linux with python3 in PATH, execute 'start.sh'. Otherwise run 'src/main.py' from the directory with 'start.sh' using python3.
